# dev_test_qt

Write an application which simulates the development and testing of a software application, as follows:
1. The information about the development team is in a text file. Each member of the team - User has a
name (string) and a type (string), which indicates whether the user is a tester or a programmer. This
file is manually created and it is read when the application starts.
2. Another file contains information about the issues reported by the testers. Each Issue has a description
(string), a status (can be open or closed), the reporter – the name of the person who reported it and
the solver – the name of the person who solved it. These are read when the application starts and are
also stored in the file by the program.
3. When the application is launched, a new window is created for each user, having as title the user’s
name and type (tester or programmer). (0.5p)
4. Each window will show all the issues, with their description, status, reporter and solver, sorted by
status and by description. (1p)
5. Only testers can report issues, by inputting the issue’s description and pressing a button “Add”. The
issue’s reporter will automatically be set – this will be the name of the tester who added it. This
operation fails if the description is empty or if there is another issue with the same description. The
user will be informed if the operation fails. (1.25p)
6. Both programmers and users can remove issues. An issue can only be removed if its status is closed.
(1p)
7. Only programmers can resolve issues, by selecting the issue and pressing a button “Resolve”. This
button is activated only if the status of selected issue is open. When an issue is resolved, the name of
the issue’s solver is automatically updated to the name of the programmer who solved it. (1.25p)
8. When a modification is made by any user, all the other users will see the modified list of issues. (2p)
9. When the application is finished, the issues file will be updated. (0.5p)
Observations
1. 1p default
2. Specify and test the following functions (repository / controller):
a. Function which adds an issue. (0.5p)
b. Function which updates an issue’s status and programmer. (0.5p)
3. Use a layered architecture. If you do not use a layered architecture, you will receive 50% of each
functionality.
4. If you do not read the data from file, you will receive 50% of functionalities 3, 4, 5 and 6
